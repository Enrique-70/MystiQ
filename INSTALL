### Arch Linux

For Arch Linux, edit `/etc/pacman.conf` and add the following (the order of the repositories is important in pacman.conf, because pacman always downloads the first package it finds):

[home_llamaret_Arch]
SigLevel = Never
Server = https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/llamaret/Arch/$arch

Then run the following as root

pacman -Syu
pacman -S home_llamaret_Arch/mystiq  
  
Hint:
To check that all external programs are installed,
please run mystiq on the console and control
the output section "---Begin Search external tools---"
